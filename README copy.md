# VBA-Challenge
assignment week 2
##Multiple year stock data analyized alphabetically as well as on yearly basis

In this project we worked on the whole data which was collected five days a week for three years.

With the huge volume of data, using vba scripts, it is helpful to find the opening and closing values of different ticker throughout the given period of time.

we can assign the cells and range in which we want our records to be printed

we used for loops and nested for loops iteration to retrive the unique ticker , corresponding opening and closing values of the stock

we did the conditional formatting to make our data look better by using percentage,color index,max ,min 

we used the same scripts to run through all the worksheets in the workbook
